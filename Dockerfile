# One Dockerfile for every service. Build a service from the solution root:
#
#   docker build --build-arg SERVICE=<Service folder name> --build-arg GIT_SHA=<commit> -t <image> .
#
# The common stage depends only on src/common, src/capabilities and the build props, and the service stage
# only adds the service's own folder. A change in one service therefore leaves every other service's image
# untouched - same layers, same digest - and the shared code is compiled once per change to it, not once
# per service. GIT_SHA should be the last commit that touched the service's inputs, not the current
# one; otherwise every commit changes every image (see the deploy scripts).
