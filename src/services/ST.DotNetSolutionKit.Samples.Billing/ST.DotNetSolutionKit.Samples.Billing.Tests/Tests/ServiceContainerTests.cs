/// <remarks>
/// A missing registration otherwise shows up on the first request or job that needs it, in whatever
/// environment that happens. Building the application here runs the same validation the service runs at
/// startup, without a database, a broker or a secret store: they are switched off in configuration, which
/// keeps their code registered and leaves out only what would connect.
///
/// The switches are environment variables because the service reads them after its files; they are set
/// for the duration of the test, so the fixture does not run in parallel with others.
