/// Capture normally happens in the SaveChanges interceptor, which reads the change tracker. A write
/// issued as set-based SQL — <c>ExecuteUpdateAsync</c>, <c>ExecuteDeleteAsync</c>, raw commands —
/// never reaches the tracker, so no entry is produced however the entity is marked. A balance moved
/// with <c>ExecuteUpdateAsync</c>, to stay correct under concurrent writes, is the usual example.

/// <para>
/// This is deliberately not a general escape hatch. Use it where an operator makes a decision that
/// the tracker cannot observe: a manual balance correction, a transfer between accounts. Machine
/// traffic that happens to be set-based, such as a counter bumped per request, stays out: one entry per
/// event would bury the journal, and whatever records the traffic itself already answers for it.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The call joins the caller's transaction, exactly like interceptor-captured entries: the message
/// goes to the outbox through the same <c>DbContext</c>, so a rolled back correction leaves no
/// record of having happened.
