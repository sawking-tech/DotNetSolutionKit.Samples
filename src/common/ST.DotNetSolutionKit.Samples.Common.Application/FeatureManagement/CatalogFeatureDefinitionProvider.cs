/// The library owns evaluation — <c>IFeatureManager</c>, <c>[FeatureGate]</c>, per-request snapshots —
/// and none of that is worth writing again. It only needs to be told what the features are, which is
/// this class: the catalogue answers with the platform's own schema, and each entry is handed over as
/// a definition the library understands.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The translation is deliberately blunt. Our flags are on or off once the environment has been taken
/// into account, so an enabled feature arrives as always-on and a disabled one as a definition with no
/// filters. The library's own filters — percentages, time windows, targeting — are not used, because
/// the environment override already covers the case we have, and the rest is machinery nobody asked
/// for.
/// </para>

/// Definitions are built per call rather than cached, so a flag edited in configuration takes effect
/// on a running service through the library as well, not only through the catalogue.
