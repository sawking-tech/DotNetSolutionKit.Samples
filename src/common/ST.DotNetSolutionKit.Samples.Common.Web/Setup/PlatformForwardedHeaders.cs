/// The request as the proxy in front received it: the client address, scheme, host and path base from
/// <c>X-Forwarded-For</c>, <c>-Proto</c>, <c>-Host</c> and <c>-Prefix</c>.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Behind a TLS proxy or a gateway a service sees plain HTTP from the proxy's address, sent to the
/// service's own host and path. Without this the access token cookie would be written without
/// <c>Secure</c>, every log line and rate limit would carry the proxy's address instead of the client's,
/// and the links a service builds - the <c>Location</c> of a 201, a redirect - would point at the
/// service's internal address, which the client cannot reach and should not see. YARP sends all four
/// headers by default.
///
/// <c>ForwardedHeaders:AllowedHosts</c> lists the public host names <c>X-Forwarded-Host</c> may carry
/// (<c>*.example.com</c> for subdomains); empty takes any, as the service takes any <c>Host</c>.
///
/// By default the headers are accepted from any address: in containers the proxy's address changes, and
/// the deployment files publish a service on the host's loopback only, so nothing but the proxy reaches
/// it. A service reachable from elsewhere lists its proxies in <c>ForwardedHeaders:KnownProxies</c> or
/// <c>ForwardedHeaders:KnownNetworks</c> (CIDR), and the headers from any other address are ignored.
/// <c>ForwardedHeaders:ForwardLimit</c> is the number of proxies in the chain, 1 by default.
