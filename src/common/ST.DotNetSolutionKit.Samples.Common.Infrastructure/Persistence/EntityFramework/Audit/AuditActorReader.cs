/// The actor comes from claims, and asking for a user id when there are no claims throws — which is
/// exactly the situation inside a Hangfire job or a bus consumer. Reading it eagerly turned the
/// audit trail into a dependency of the work: a scheduled job failed with "User ID claim is missing",
/// from a stack that ran through the interceptor.

/// A change nobody can be attributed to is still a change worth recording, so an unreadable actor
/// degrades to the system actor rather than aborting the save. The journal is a witness; a witness
/// does not get to stop the event.
