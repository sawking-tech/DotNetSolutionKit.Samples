/// A bulk write is invisible to the audit interceptor: <c>ExecuteUpdateAsync</c> never reaches the

/// the operator is waiting on the block to apply, not on its paperwork.

/// The snapshots must be taken inside the writing transaction. Afterwards the previous values are
/// gone, and reading them post-commit would also cost the property this journal is built on: the
