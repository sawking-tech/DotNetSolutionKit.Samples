/// The difference from <see cref="AuditIgnoreAttribute"/> is the whole point of this attribute.
/// Ignoring a secret would erase the event as well as the value: a password change touches nothing
/// else, so the diff would come back empty and the interceptor drops empty diffs. "The password was
/// changed, by whom and when" is exactly what an audit journal exists to answer, so the property
/// stays in the diff and both sides are replaced with <see cref="Placeholder"/>.
