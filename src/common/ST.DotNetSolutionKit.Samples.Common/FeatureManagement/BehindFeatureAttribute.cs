/// This is not how a flag is evaluated — that is <c>IFeatureManager</c> in code and
/// <c>[FeatureGate]</c> on an endpoint. This says something different and longer-lived: the class,
/// the method, the property carrying it are there for the flag, and go when the flag goes.

/// <para>
/// Retiring a flag always ends in the same question — what can be deleted. Searching for the key
/// finds the places that read it, not the code that exists for it, so the answer is usually pieced
/// together from memory. The marker turns that into a search.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// It reads in the other direction too: marked code being lifted out and reused elsewhere is a sign
/// the flag has already done its job and is now only ceremony.
