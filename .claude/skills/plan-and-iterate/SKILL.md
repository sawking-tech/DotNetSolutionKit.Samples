description: Discipline for long work that does not finish in one go - a migration, a port, a large refactoring, an investigation, a big document. The plan is a KDL file on disk with one item in work, checks written before the run, and a utility that keeps the invariants.
---

Discipline for long work of any kind: moving a code base, a migration, a refactoring, a
long investigation, a large document, taking apart someone else's system, a report. The structure is the
same.

## What the plan is

**The queue of what we do, plus the working memory of the current item.** Not a log, not an archive of
decisions, not a wish list.

The queue answers "what to work on": items by importance, a marker on the current one. The working memory
answers "what I know about the current item": the approach, what turned up, what I tripped over. It holds
the progress, so what is done is not checked again and what was ruled out is not tried again. Memory blurs
within a few hours; the plan does not.

**The plan lives in a file on disk, outside the conversation and outside the repository.** In the chat it
dies with the session; committed, it travels to every copy as someone else's clutter. Its place is
`.claude/session-context/`, which `.gitignore` keeps out of the repository.

**The disk is the source of truth, always.** Only what outlives the plan goes elsewhere: a decision taken,
an analysis, a technique - into the issue tracker or the docs. The plan has no second store.

**One task, one plan document.** Do not start a new one: read the existing one first and make sure there
is nothing to edit. Otherwise in a week the same thing exists in three versions.

**Why KDL.** A Markdown checklist has one structural token, `- [ ]`: an item has no boundary and no address,
it can be referred to only by its text, and the text drifts when rewritten - which is how items get lost. A
KDL node has an address and its state as a property, is found with one `grep`, and is edited in place.

## Item states and transitions

The states exclude each other: one at a time.

| State | Attribute | Entered when | What must appear on entry |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| queued | none | the item is added | `why`, `how`, `done_when` |
| in work | `now=true` | taken into work | `since`; the marker removed from the previous item - there is one per plan |
| blocked | `blocked="reason"` | waits for someone's answer or an event | an item that unblocks it (rule below) |
| closed | `done=true` | `done_when` is met | `at`; free notes moved to the issue, `issue=` stays |
| dead end | `dropped="why"` | the path was tried and does not work | the reason in words; survives the cleanup of closed items |

**The transitions most often skipped:**

- **into work -> always `since`**, also when the marker was left from the previous session: nothing moved
  there, so the stamp would never appear. A `now=true` without `since` gets the current time.
- **`blocked` -> into work: `since` is reset.** Otherwise the block counts as work.
- **`ok=false` on a check -> a new item in the plan.** A mismatch is fixed, not noted as "seen".
- **`blocked` does not mean "start the neighbour".** Go to the next item in order; unblocking is an item of
  its own with its own `done_when`, or nobody does it.

## Attributes that are not states

| Attribute | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `since="2026-08-30 03:36"` / `at="..."` | stamps on the transitions: taken into work and closed |
| `depends="other-item"` | the current item is pointless without it; set where the order is not obvious |
| `issue="#88"` | the link to the tracker's issue; stays in place of the notes that moved there |
| `state="in words"` | only on a large node: it aggregates sub-items, and one state is not enough |

`state` on a single step is a hole in the state machine: everything that did not fit goes there, and in a
month it has its own vocabulary. If a state is missing, add it to the table or split the item; do not
describe it in words.

**About the stamps.** Local time, to the minute. **Never set after the fact:** a stamp reconstructed from
history measures neither the time in the queue nor the pauses between sessions, and in the file it cannot
be told from a measured one - the first statistic would be computed on the mix. Read the stamps as a
calendar interval: items overlap at the start, so the sum is longer than the session and does not add up to
"time spent".

## Inside a node

```kdl
step order-number-from-sequence "An order's number comes from a sequence, before the order exists" issue="#131" {
    why "The order-created event carries number 0: the number is assigned by the database after the insert"
    how "Take the number with IShortIdGenerator before the constructor; the migration creates the sequence"
    done_when "an order created through the API has its number in the event the consumer receives"

    check "a created order has a number" got="ORD-1042 in the response and in the outbox row" ok=true
    check "two orders created at once get different numbers" got="1043 and 1044" ok=true
    check "a rolled-back create leaves a gap, not a duplicate"
}
```

- **`why` / `how` / `done_when`** - one each on **every** item, **one line each**. An analysis a paragraph
  long goes to the tracker: these three are the first to swell. Without `done_when` an item is an
  intention, not a plan: it can only be closed by eye.
- **`note`** - a free note, **only on the item with `now=true`**. It needs no limit; the limit comes by
  itself, since there is one current item. A swollen item that is not current is a symptom: the far work
  was written out before it was reached.
- **`check` / `got` / `ok`** - a check and its result. `check` is written **before** the run and stays bare,
  like the third one above; `got` and `ok` are added after. Writing both at once is making up the fact
  together with the expectation.

**The id is opaque** - a slug, not a number. A hierarchical number conflicts with inserting by importance:
the place between `1.159` and `1.16` is taken by adding a digit, and `1.1595` is born. Priority is carried
by the position, so the id must mean nothing.

## What lives where

| Where | What goes there |
| --- | --- |
| the plan | the queue, the states of the items, the working memory of the current one |
| the issue tracker | the history: the symptom, the cause found, the analysis, the rejected option, the decision |
| a run log | an audit of the rounds, where the work goes in repeated passes |

**The plan holds the queue, the tracker the history.** Closed items leave the plan; what is worth keeping
moves to the issue. Appending to the end and keeping closed items is what turns a plan into a warehouse:
one grew to 2730 lines.

**Far work is not written out in advance** - it stays an issue and is expanded when reached. Written out
early, half of it is stale by then.

## How it is read and shown

**The order of the document is the priority.** Everything above the current item is closed; an open item
left above reads as done - and is forgotten. Before marking: is there an open item above the current one?
If there is, it is either finished or moved down.

**New items are inserted by importance, not at the end:** first what blocks the next step, then what is
expensive to fix later. Improvements with no one asking go to the end; that is where they usually stay.

**Where I am** - `node .claude/skills/plan-and-iterate/plan.mjs where`: the current item in full, the next
ones as numbers with slugs, a count of violations at the bottom. Without the tool: `grep -n "now=true" <plan>`.

**In an answer the plan is shown as plain numbers, not slugs:** "1, 2, 3" in document order from the
current item, five to seven items. The numbering lives only in the answer.

## The line

**One task in work.** Taken, finished. Not "I will fix the neighbour on the way", not "first a wider look
around": what is noticed goes into the plan as an item, not as an edit into the current file. Unfinished
work looks finished, and it cannot be resumed without its context.

**Agreement without grounds moves the marker; it is not a line in an answer.** Agreeing is the way to drop
what was started, only with permission: agree with a remark - move the marker - lose the item you were on.
Models do this systematically, which is why the rule lives here and not in manners.

An agreement must leave a trace in the file: an accepted remark **becomes an item** in the queue, or it
cancels the premise of the current item, and then the marker moves at once. **Agreeing without touching the
plan is the same as not agreeing.** An objection is said briefly and with a fact, but an accepted decision
lands in the plan too.

Where `depends` is not set, the one doing the work chooses the order - and takes what the next step cannot
do without, not what is more interesting.

**The plan first, then the work.** Not "do it and write it down": between two marks there is time to drift
into three tasks, the marker is in the wrong place, and an open item hangs above. The sign of the violation
is an edit before an edit of the plan.

**The plan is kept by the one doing the work, without asking** - neither for an item's wording, nor for a
reordering, nor for moving the marker. Asking for permission for that is a way to stand still. The other
person is asked about a fork in the work itself, not about how to write it down.

**The plan is dynamic.** It takes in the traps (the part turned out bigger than it looked), the decisions
said aloud ("noted", "that goes there"), and the idea of how to approach. Not written down - not decided.
Changed your mind - rewrite it: that is the ordinary course of work, not a sign of a mistake.

## Rounds instead of one pass

Where the result is not known in advance - a migration, someone else's system, a repeated run:

1. Take a step.
2. Compare it with the expectation, do not just "look".
3. On failure, fix it **at the source**, not where it showed.
4. Repeat the round the same way, with the same check.

**An audit of each round**: the symptom, the cause, what was fixed and where, in which round the trap went
away. A round without traps is written down too - it shows the part was passed, not skipped.

## The check stage

**One stage of work, one stage of checking**, right when the stage is done. Do not wait for the end: what
piles up has nobody and no time to check it, and finding which of ten changes led to the bad result costs
more than checking each in place.

| What the stage is | How it is checked |
| --- | --- |
| something shown on a page | a smoke test: the route by eye, in both themes and at three widths |
| behaviour of a server | requests step by step through the scenario, checking what reached the database |
| a rule of the model | the spec, and a run of it through the solver |
| a migration or a move | a run on a copy and a comparison with the source, round by round |
| a document, a report | rereading it against the original requirement: what was promised and what is written |
| an investigation | reproducing the finding from scratch, from your own notes |

**The check is concrete, with sub-items** - a `check` for each. "Needs checking" is not a check, it is a
promise with nothing to close it by. Expectations are written **before** the run, the fact goes into `got`.

## Progress marks

**Tied to events, not to the clock:** a check closed; the marker moved; a check stage passed; new input
arrived. An interval catches the consequences - between two firings there is time to drift into three
tasks.

**A timer is the safety net** for when no event comes for a long time: then the work stalled and nobody
noticed. Every half hour; where the agent supports a scheduled prompt in the session, it is set at the start
of the session. Its text:

> A mark on the way, not the finish and not a request for permission. Take the fact: where the work stands.
> Read the plan (`grep "now=true"`): am I on the right item, what is next, drifted - go back. Extend the
> plan if the part turned out bigger or decisions were said. Mark what is closed. Continue at once.

No long reports: what was done is visible in the work and in the plan. A mark answered with a wall of text
stops being read.

## The utility next to the skill

`plan.mjs` lies here and covers what is done wrong and silently by hand. The plan is still edited by the one
doing the work: there is no command for every edit and there will not be, or half of the operations would
bypass the tool. The plan file comes from `PLAN_FILE`, by default `.claude/session-context/plan.kdl`.

| Command | What for |
| --- | --- |
| `where [N]` | where I am: the current item in full and N next ones as numbers with slugs |
| `check` | five invariants, exit code 1 on violations |
| `take <slug>` | remove the old marker, set the new one, set `since` - three changes at once |
| `done <slug>` | `at` and the marker removed; refused without `done_when` or with checks not passed |
| `add <slug> "<title>" --before/--after <slug>` | add an item **into a gap**: the position from a neighbour, the id a word |

**Inserting into a gap** removes the need to invent a number - that is where `1.1595` comes from. **The tool
sets the time**: a time written by hand once was seven minutes ahead of the clock, and the session showed a
negative length. **Nothing is repaired silently** - a repair would kill the very signal that the marker is
moved the wrong way.

Run it at the start of a session and on every progress mark.

## When to cut

A plan has a limit - a hundred lines and scrolling instead of a glance. So does this skill: **past two
hundred and some lines, cut.** Cut tables and examples, merge places that drifted apart, but **not the
reasons**: a rule without its reason gets reinterpreted.

The one check on the result of a cut: was something that has no column silently dropped - the criterion for
a turn, the event-driven marks, what goes where. That is behaviour, not the state machine.

## Conversation

**A remark is a refinement**, not an order to turn around: add it as an item and continue.

**A turn is different, and the sign is exact:** "stop", "instead", "now", or a remark that cancels the
premise of the current item. Then the marker moves at once. Without this criterion "the plan is kept by the
one doing the work" becomes a reason to postpone a real change.

**Do not turn the work into an audit.** Counting, comparing and writing reports about how everything is
arranged is an imitation. The work is the part that is done: changed code, a written section, a question
closed.
